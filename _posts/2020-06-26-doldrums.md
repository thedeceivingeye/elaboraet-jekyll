As temperatures rise, and as time's ever-running clock makes its way to summertime, the crisp clarity with which I lived my life during the months prior starts to become a blur, as if melting in the sudden heat. My sharp, motivating aspirations begin to lose the edge they once had, whose dullness turns me into a functional sleepwalker, seldom awakening to reality's pokes.

A caricature of myself, I hoard the last sputtering embers of my crisp, winter and springtime energy. In this vain effort, I reread once-inspiring, electrifying passages that now drift past like any other, their meaning suddenly undiscoverable to my now-slothful mind. I listen to passionately-told lectures whose energy once motivated my mind, at one time awake: but their words, no matter how powerful, now simply slip away from ever reaching my sleepwalking self.

Deep into the warmer weeks, my old winter routines become an uphill climb to continue - fervent listening to a downloaded lecture soon becomes lazy, no-notes listening; writing at least a hundred words per day, whether by email or post, degenerates to not writing at all. Your backyard plants and trees mature to a deep, luscious green - but the ones inside me start to grow brown and wither.
