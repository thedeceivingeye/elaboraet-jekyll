As temperatures rise, and as time's ever-running clock makes its way to summertime, the crisp clarity with which I lived my life during the winter and early spring starts to become a blur. My sharp, motivating aspirations begin to lose the edges they once had. I become a perpetual sleepwalker, seldom awakening to reality's pokes.

A caricature of myself, I hoard my last sputtering embers of energy and youthfulness. I reread once-inspiring passages that now drift past like any other. And, deep into the warmer weeks, my old winter routines become an uphill climb to continue - fervent listening to a downloaded lecture soon becomes lazy, no-notes listening; writing at least a hundred words per day, whether by email or post, degenerates to not writing at all. Your backyard plants and trees mature to a deep, luscious green - but the ones inside me start to grow brown and wither.
