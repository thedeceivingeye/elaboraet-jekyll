On July 5th, I've redesigned Elaboraet using the "Mundana" layout on Jekyll. The style appealed to me, firstly, because it has an article-gallery layout which readers can easily navigate on any recent device. And, secondly, for its speed, which stands in stark contrast with *WordPress.*

Visiting Elaboraet, one finds a well-tiled gallery of articles. Its style doesn't repel users with ultra-minimalism, and neither does it repel them with snail-paced scripts and dynamic content. This statically-generated newspaper layout brings our writing to full relief with lightweight, helpful styling.

Where WordPress yielded initial page-load times of over three-and-a-half seconds on mobile, moreover, this Jekyll-based version of Elaboraet pops up within one. On a second visit, it appears in the blink of an eye - ideal in improving user experience. 

## We Must Admit...

...that we don't mean to come off as totally-committed, official authors. In fact, we'd come closer to the definition of "hobbyist." We like writing, and sometimes do try to write full-fledged, readable articles - but life's complexities and priorities take no hesitation in obstructing one's hobbies. We're growing writers, and definitely aren't professionals; and neither does Elaboraet take first-priority in our lives. For these reasons, we do not yet have an established publishing schedule, and you shouldn't expect one very soon.

In the meantime, however, we expect to keep this as a little "portfolio," if you will, of what we've decided to write in our free time.

Welcome to Elaboraet, redesigned.
