I've renovated Elaboraet.

Here's what happened:
- I took down the original WordPress installation. I doubt you'll believe how slow it was.
- Considered a pure HTML/CSS design and found Jekyll. I do realize that I have tried Jekyll before, leaving it in frustration, but I decided to continue with it.
- Lo and behold: Elaboraet loads faster, no longer has a slow, enormous backend, and looks fresh. A fruitful outcome, as patience and endurance often yield.
