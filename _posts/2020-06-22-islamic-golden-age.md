During his ninth-century reign, the seventh Abbasid caliph Al-Ma’mun established the Bayt al-Hikmah—the House of Wisdom. He founded this academy during a period historians term the Translation Movement, when sponsored scholars translated earlier texts like the Organon and other Hellenistic, even Indian texts into Syriac or Arabic. Most of these translated texts were kept in the House’s libraries (Meri et al. 610), and some historians suggest it to have held at least 100,000 volumes while, during the same century, Europe’s largest library in Paris housed just around four hundred (Winter). But the Translation Movement soon traveled with the Arabs to other countries, especially Spain. Through Spain the works of prominent Muslim philosophers such as Ibn Sina percolated into Europe’s reluctantly curious population. That Europeans Latinized his name to Avicenna alone suggests his prominent and reaching influence into the continent. Anticipating two of St. Thomas Aquinas’ proofs by contributing to the Kalam arguments, Ibn Sina argued that all creatures necessarily exist by depending “on causes external to” them. He established all creatures’ contingency, as opposed to God’s self-dependent Existence upon which creation depends (Meri et al. 370; Rizvi 1). Aquinas accordingly reiterates God’s Necessary Existence in his Summa Theologica’s third proof: “[Not] all beings are merely possible, but there must exist something the existence of which is necessary...not receiving [its necessity] from another” (Doc. 5). Exactly reflecting Ibn Sina, Aquinas argues that creatures exist by depending on other creatures. This relation’s inability to infinitely regress accordingly reveals an independent, self-sufficient God, “Whose One Necessary [Existence] is due to Itself [Alone]” (Meri et al. 370). Some scholars even speculate that Aquinas obtained his first and last Aristotelian proofs from Arabic translations of Aristotle that reached him in Latin. Many in Aquinas’s time, including the pope (Brown), sought his proofs. Through Baghdad’s outreaching Translation Movement, the precursor Muslim ideas to Aquinas’s proofs contributed to the European intellectual revival.
