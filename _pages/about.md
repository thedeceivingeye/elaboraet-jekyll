>“Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself.”

Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi.

## Our Vision

Welcome to Elaboraet. We are a group of three writers who ventured to collaboratively author essays and articles about education, philosophy, cultural criticism, and otherwise. We created Elaboraet as a website dedicated to writing.

We plan to use the homepage as a contiguous stream of complete essays, each of which may serve as a launchpad for future articles or bite-sized discussions. Each essay appears as a post with its own comments section, and will typically range from two to fifteen paragraphs, about five to twenty-five minutes reading time.

The Articles section contains fuller, comprehensively written, proof-read articles dedicated to discussing or reporting on coherent topics. A typical article will range from four to sixty paragraphs, about seven to sixty minutes reading time.

Welcome to Elaboraet, a work-in-progress website dedicated to writing.
