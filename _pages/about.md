As a writing exercise, two friends and I joined to refresh my formerly one-man writing project, *Elaboraet,* into a collaborative one. We think the name *Elaboraet,* a purposeful misspelling of Elaborate (adj.), presents our vision well. We'll use this as a medium to voice our thoughts and practice articulating them in an eloquent, clear, and concise way. 

I'm Umit, the one writing this page. I'll leave with you one of my favorite quotations from *Rumi:*

>“Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself.”
