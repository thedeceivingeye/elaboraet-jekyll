## Our Vision
Along with myself are two other friends - as a collective effort we aspire to write articles, essays, and reflections. But we don't just want to influence other people. We want to influence and improve ourselves.

> Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself.

*Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi.*

## Technical Information
